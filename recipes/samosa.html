        <h3>Description</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>We almost never order Indian food without getting some samosas along with it, and good news: Homemade samosas don't need to be intimidating. 
            The spiced potato filling is quick and easy and the dough comes together quickly using melted ghee. 
            The crust is sturdy, but still fries up extra crisp and shatter-y. You may need to hunt down some spices and seeds, but it's well worth it. 
            Asafoetida, amchur, ajwain seeds can be found at most South Asian markets or online. 
            While these are all technically optional, the samosas taste most authentic and best with them! We recommend serving samosas with a mint chutney.</p>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <hr>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Make the filling: Place potato into a medium pot and cover with water. 
                Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are fork tender, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. 
                Use a fork to smash potatoes into smaller chunks with still some bigger pieces remaining.</li>
                <br>
            <li>In a medium skillet, melt ghee over medium heat. 
                Add cumin and cook until darkened and fragrant, about 1 minute. 
                Add green chili and ginger and cook, stirring, 1 minute more. 
                Add potatoes and spices and toss to coat. Stir in peas and cilantro and season with salt to taste. 
                Remove from heat and let cool. </li><br>
            <li>Make the dough: In a large bowl, combine flour, ajwain seeds, and salt. 
                Add ghee and ice water and stir until dough comes together. 
                Adding more water 1 tablespoon at a time as needed until dough holds together easily without feeling sticky. 
                Form into a disc and cover in plastic wrap. 
                Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. </li><br>
            <li>Make the samosas: Divide dough into 6 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball. 
                Work with one ball of dough at a time and keep remaining dough covered with plastic wrap to prevent them from drying out.</li><br>
            <li>Roll each piece of dough into an oval that's ¼” thick and about 7” long and 5” wide. 
                Cut in half crosswise. Wet the cut side of dough with a little water and bring the edges together to form a cone, pressing to seal. 
                (Check the tip is sealed as well.) 
                Hold the cone in one hand and fill with about 1 tablespoon of filling. 
                Wet the edges with more water and press together to seal. 
                Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li><br>
            <li>Fill a large, heavy- bottomed pot with about 2” of oil and fit with a deep fry thermometer. 
                Place over medium heat until oil reaches 350°. 
                A small piece of dough dropped into the oil should take a few seconds to start bubbling and rise to the surface. 
                Without overcrowding the pot, working in batches if necessary, add samosas to oil and fry, turning occasionally, until deeply golden, about 10 to 12 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary to keep oil at 350°F. 
                Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer samosas to a paper towel-lined plate as they are ready. 
                Let cool slightly before serving.</li><br>
            <li>Serve warm with chutney.</li>
